      <h4>
        Total Black-Owned Businesses currently on LocalBLM: <strong><u>402</u></strong>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Hello everyone!<br><br>My name is Michael and I'm just an average Joe based out of Austin, TX.  My goal with this project is to make it easier for the general public to support blacked-owned businesses.  There are several lists that can be found online but few are organized in a manner that can be navigated quickly.  With this tool we placed a heavy emphasis on intuitiveness by breaking down each business by both location and category.  On our site we will never use advertisements, charge for our services and/or collect your personal information without permission.  Lastly, I vow to continually update this directory during my free time by perpetually adding cities, states and/or black-owned businesses to the directory. <br><br> Please bear with me, my time is very limited as I still have an 8-5 day job (I also like to spend time with my wife).  I do welcome any feedback, suggestions and/or constructive criticism so please feel free to message me by clicking on the "message us" link on the bottom of this page. <br><br> The information found within this tool was obtained by scouring the internet so I cannot gaurantee it's accuracy.  That being said, PLEASE let me know of any errors.  It is not my intention to exclude any black-owned businesses and/or present false information.  We plan on sponsoring some of our posts (with our own hard earned money) in order to reach a wider audience and make a bigger impact.  Also out of pocket, we are paying for the website domain, email/database services etc so any donations for the cause are more than welcome and greatly appreciated.  Please click on the "donate" link below if you're interested in supporting our cause but know that there is no financial expectation of any kind when you use our tool.  <br><br> <strong>Important:</strong> Coding is not my expertise so I was unable to make this tool work properly on Internet Explorer.  However, all other browsers seem to operate perfectly! (i.e. Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari etc).
