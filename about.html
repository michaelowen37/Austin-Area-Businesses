      <div>
      <p>Hello everyone!<br><br>My name is Michael and I'm just an average Joe based out of Austin, TX.  My goal with this project is to make it easier for the general public to support blacked-owned businesses.  There are several lists that can be found online but few are organized in a manner that can be navigated quickly.  With this tool we placed a heavy emphasis on intuitiveness by breaking down each business by both location and category.  We will never use advertisements, charge for our services and/or ask for personal information.  Lastly, I vow to continually update this directory during my free time by continually adding cities, states and black-owned businesses. <br><br> Please bear with me, my time is very limited as I still have an 8-5 day job (and like to spend time with my wife).  I do welcome any feedback, suggestions and/or constructive criticism so please feel free to message me (details below).  The information found within this tool was obtained by scouring the internet so I cannot gaurantee it's accuracy.  That being said, PLEASE let me know of any errors.  It is not my intention to exclude any black-owned businesses and/or include false information.  We plan on sponsoring some of our posts (with our own hard earned money) in order to reach a wider audience and make a bigger impact.  We are also paying for the website domain out of pocket so any donations for the cause are welcome and appreciated.  <br><br> <b>Contact:</b> michaelowen37@gmail.com <br><br><b>Important:</b> Coding is not my expertise so I was unable to make this tool work properly on Internet Explorer.  However, all other browsers seem to work perfectly! (i.e. Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari etc).</p>
